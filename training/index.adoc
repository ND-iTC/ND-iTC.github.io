== GitHub Overview
=== Introduction
The ND iTC has migrated away from MS Word to ASCiiDoc in GitHub for version control and collaboration. The ND iTC GitHub Organization can be found at https://github.com/ND-iTC.

=== Issues
Issue templates have been created to help gather the required information from contributors that have comments on the ND iTC such as typos, corrections, or enhancements. Comments may be provided via the GitHub issue tracker, https://github.com/ND-iTC/Documents/issues/new/choose.

For an explanation on how to use the GitHub issue tracker please refer to the GitHub Docs article at https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue.

=== Teams
GitHub Teams have been setup by working group with permissions added to allow which branches can be edited, https://github.com/orgs/ND-iTC/teams.

=== Repositories
